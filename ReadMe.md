# Discovery Of DotNet 
* .Net - Microsoft's Software Development Platform since 2001. (similar to Java Virtual Machine)
* Active Server Pages -Dynamic web pages, usually connected to a database.
* .Net is NOT a language.
* The .Net framework consists of runtime engine and libraris for executing programs written in a compliant language. 
* The .Net frameowrk is language neutral that supports more 20 languages that includes: C#, C++, VB, Java/J++, Fortran, ruby, Python...
* C# is the most popular programming language to write applications for the .Net framework.

#### Why Do We Need ASP.NET ?
* Starting 1997 there was a huge push away from fat client desktop applications and a migration toward browser based web applications.
* Asp.Net was Micsrosoft's answer in 2002 to Sun's maturing enterprise Java Platform.
* Asp.Net replaced the Classic ASP (Active Server Pages) technology.

#### A Daynamic ASP.NET
* An Asp.Net page is web page that contains mix of HTML markup and dynamic ASP markup.
* An Asp.Net is run on the server, combining the static HTML code, and updating the dynamic ASP elements to produce a final HTML page.

### Back End and Front end Options
* ASP.NET Core is Full Stack (Database, Business Logic, HTML)
* Can be combined with popular front-end services
	* React, Angular, Vue
	* Mobile apps

#### MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
* The MVC design pattern helps to enforce <b>seperation of concerns</b> to help you avoid mixing presentation logic, business logic, and data access logic together.
* MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
	Model: Manages the behavior and data
	View: Manages the display of data
	Controller: Handles page events and navigation between pages

#### Database Setup
| Data Access Object (DAO)                      | Object Relational Mapper (ORM)                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manually create tables                        | Allow the computer to generate database tables based on classes defined in the application. |
| Traditional method of database access         | Auto connecting via connection string                                                       |
| Write your own SQL statements                 | Database is updated using migrations                                                        |
| Database manages (DBA's) useally prefer DAO's | Entity Framework is Microsoft's ORM                                                         |
| Provides more visibility on finding problems  | Simple for basic applications                                                               |
### 1. Starfighter
This working will show you how to :
- Use the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
- Configure database tables using the Entity framework.
- Setup of classes as models. Customize Razor forms.
- Create methods inside a controller.
